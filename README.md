# Logic Fundamentals Challenges

## Project Description
This repository serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating foundational **algorithmic logic, conditional control flow, and data manipulation**. It is structured to prove proficiency in core programming concepts essential for systems development.

The solutions are implemented in self-contained, parameter-driven functions, allowing the code to be executed directly in a Node.js environment.

## Structure and Languages
The solutions are organized by language to clearly demonstrate logical equivalence across different programming environments.

* **JavaScript:** Complete solutions for 24 challenges are located in the `/javascript` directory.
* **Python:** Implementation is planned for the future.

## Key Features & Code Architecture
* **Single File Organization:** All 24 algorithms are organized within a single file (`exercisesJS.js`), demonstrating effective function structuring and module management.
* **Strict Input Validation:** Each function includes explicit checks for input types (`number`, `string`, `boolean`) and value limits (e.g., non-negative, non-zero), a critical practice for robust software.
* **Conditional Logic Mastery:** Challenges cover a range of conditional statements (`if/else`, `switch`), complex boolean logic, and the effective use of arithmetic/modulo operators for problem-solving.
* **Testing Block:** Includes a dedicated **Execution Block** at the end of the file to run all 24 functions with hardcoded test cases, ensuring instant verifiability.
